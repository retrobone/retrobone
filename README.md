# Hi there, I'm Kevin B! 👋

### 👨‍💻 Aspiring Programmer | 🎮 Game Modder | 🎓 BCA Student

I'm an undergrad student based in **Delhi, India**, currently pursuing my **BCA at Maharaja Surajmal Institute (MSI), Janakpuri**.

I have a solid foundation in **C, HTML, and CSS**, with some experience in **Java**. Currently, I'm leveling up my skills in **C++ and Python**. My niche lies in **reverse engineering old games and Game Modding**. Beyond just writing code, I have a passion for exploring **unorthodox ideas**—I love taking things apart to see how they tick and rebuilding them in ways that were never intended.

### 💡 What Drives Me
* **Unconventional Solutions:** I believe the "standard" way isn't always the *fun* way. I enjoy finding innovative, out-of-the-box solutions to niche problems, even if it means seeing a bit of failure first.
* **Reviving the Classics:** A lot of my work focuses on keeping older games (like *Brian Lara Cricket 99, Cricket 07, Rugby 08* & others) alive on modern hardware through custom patches and widescreen fixes.
* **Experimental Coding:** I'm always looking for that next weird idea to prototype.
